Cozmo-Clench – RC Controlled Robot

A high-power RC-controlled robot built using 4 Johnson motors, an L298N motor driver, and a dual-claw mechanism.
The robot is controlled using PWM signals from an EPW6 receiver + Radiomaster transmitter, supporting:

Differential drive

Independent dual claw motors

Automatic failsafe

Dead-zones for smooth response

Full ±255 speed mapping

This repository contains the Arduino firmware that powers the complete system.
